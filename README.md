<h1> Random Quote Machine </h1>
<h3>Free Code Camp</h3>

<h2>Objective:</h2>
Build a CodePen.io app that successfully generates random quotes.

<h2>Rules:</h2>

You may use whichever libraries or APIs you need.
Reverse engineer the example project's functionality, and also feel free to personalize it.

<h2>User Stories:</h2>
In software development and product management, a user story is a description consisting of one or more sentences in the everyday or business language of the end user or user of a system that captures what a user does or needs to do as part of his or her job function.
